# **🌀 Neon Pendulum Animation**  

A mesmerizing **pendulum-based visual experience** that combines **physics, neon effects, and dynamic distortions** into a **hypnotic animation**. Built with **Pygame**, this simulation features a **swinging pendulum** with a rotating hexagon, neon trails, dynamic light beams, a warped grid, and a swirling vortex effect—all working together in perfect harmony.  

---

## **✨ Features**
✅ **Realistic Pendulum Motion** – Simulates **gravity and damping** for smooth, physics-driven movement.  
✅ **Rotating Hexagon** – A hexagon at the pendulum's bob rotates, adding a **geometric aesthetic**.  
✅ **Neon Motion Trail** – Leaves behind a glowing trail that transitions from **purple to cyan**.  
✅ **Dynamic Light Beams** – Generates radial light beams when the **pendulum swings fast**.  
✅ **Warped Grid Effect** – Distorts a **grid around the pendulum**, creating a **gravity-like pull**.  
✅ **Swirling Vortex** – A collection of particles forms a **spiraling vortex** in the background.

## **🎮 How It Works**
- A **pendulum swings** from a fixed point, affected by **gravity** and **damping**.  
- A **hexagon** rotates at the bob, creating a **futuristic effect**.  
- A **neon trail** follows the pendulum’s movement, fading over time.  
- When the pendulum’s velocity exceeds a threshold, **light beams** appear.  
- The **grid near the pendulum distorts**, pulling points into **concentric warps**.  
- A **vortex of swirling particles** continuously rotates in the background.  
- The animation **automatically ends** after **10 seconds**.
